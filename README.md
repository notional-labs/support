# Support Requests Handled By Notional Labs

## Purpose

Notional frequently handsles support items for various teams in the cosmos ecosystem on an unpaid basis.  Teams that we have a contractual relationship may opt to have their support requests tracked here, or not, at their option.  This Repository exists for the purpose of gathering these support request into one place, so that we can build an internal and external knowledge base.
